### Clean Routine 
* [Summarytable1 & 2. R](https://github.com/hereagain-Y/AMR_project/blob/main/Clean%20routine/Summarytable2.R)  
An easy step was craeted for cleaning our Ast result dataset, by running these two file, a summary table1 collecting information about isolates and sample counts from every sources can rendered.   
Also, for summarytable 2, resistance rates calculated from each source in every bacterials are reported in the output excel file. A simple heatmap showing the relative frequency of resistant in E.coli is obtaind in this file. 

* [Find missing isolates. R](https://github.com/hereagain-Y/AMR_project/blob/main/Clean%20routine/Find_missing_isolates.R)  
In this file, we are aimed to find out the missing isolates which finished MULDI-TOF and validated as from the targeted bacteria, but forgot to complete AST test.

* [Questionnaire_monthly_summary.R](https://github.com/hereagain-Y/AMR_project/blob/main/Clean%20routine/Questinnaire_monthly_summary.R)  
Table 1 about our questionnaire answers is constructed, comparision can be customized to our Gender or Age accosring to the group variable. Chisq/ fisher test is applied for categorical data analysis, other wise, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test or
